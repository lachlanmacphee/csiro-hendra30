    <p class="mb-4">
      The Hendra@30 conference celebrates three decades of research, awareness,
      and collaboration in combating the Hendra virus.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The Hendra virus is a zoonotic virus that can be transmitted from animals
      to humans. It was first identified in 1994 during an outbreak of
      respiratory illness in horses and humans in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane,
      Australia. The natural reservoir of the virus is believed to be fruit bats
      (flying foxes).

      Join us in Geelong, Victoria in December 2024 to commemorate the progress
      made in understanding and combating the Hendra virus.
